Welcome to this MBAFS 540.

1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,800
So for those who took my course before, long time no see.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,880
So today, I will first spend a bit of time to talk about the information about this talk,

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,800
about the logistics, cost-content,

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,239
and of course, the most important thing is weight and scale.

5
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:26,359
But first of all, just let me introduce myself,

6
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,399
in case you are new to my courses.

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,119
So my name is Dr. Deng-Chi Man, one of the lecturers in the Department of Mathematics.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,439
So mainly in that department, I teach the course in financial mathematics, actual real-world mathematics,

9
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,679
and sometimes I also teach the things like game theory,

10
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,880
social choice theory, a lot of business.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,640
If you are interested, you can audit my course.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,439
Not take my course, it will be terrible.

13
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,200
And you will regret it, trust me.

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,920
So here is my contact information.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,040
So my office is at 13419, which is near the Nip 70 to 80.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,640
So just take the lift, go to third floor,

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,959
then you can find that.

18
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,760
So very, very convenient.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,239
And here, this is my email.

20
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,239
So in case you have any questions about the course,

21
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,079
or maybe if you have anything that you want to talk to me, something academic,

22
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,799
then just send me an email.

23
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,040
And for the office hour, so this semester,

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,159
I do have a regular office hour, which will be on every Thursday from 6.15 to 7.30,

25
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:53,239
which is the office hour for all my courses that I taught.

26
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:58,239
So mainly I teach all courses this semester.
