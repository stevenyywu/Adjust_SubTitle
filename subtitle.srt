Good evening, good to see a lot of you. So let's have a quick review of what we talked

1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:23,320
about last week. So we talked about three kinds of products last week, a bond, forward

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:31,000
and future. So bond, you know the structure. You are going to receive a huge amount of

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,560
money today or you are going to pay a huge amount of money. So the other side of the

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:48,039
mortgage. So you pay a huge amount of money and then you are going to receive a coupon

5
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:56,759
payment for a fixed period. So say every half year or every three months or something like

6
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:02,759
that. And then at the end, the maturity day, you will get your principal back. You will

7
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:11,760
get all your money back. So this is a very safe product. And then we talked about forward.

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,359
So if you want to calculate the bond price, you will start to calculating all the future

9
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:23,840
cash flows, discount all of them to today and then sum them up, you will get the bond

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,840
price. So that's how we calculate bond price. So for forward, we go back to this page 16.
